# GNSS-Signal-Security-Detection

This study aims to explore and implement effective deep learning methodologies for detecting Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal threats, specifically focusing on jamming and spoofing attacks!
In this regard, two public datasets are utilized: an IQ-based spectrogram dataset for jamming classification and a tabular dataset containing satellite signal parameters for spoofing detection, both of which are leveraged. The objective is to develop robust classification pipelines for each threat modality. These implementations not only replicate state-of-the-art deep neural network models but also highlight the efficacy of data-driven approaches in enhancing the security of GNSS-dependent systems, such as maritime navigation platforms.
